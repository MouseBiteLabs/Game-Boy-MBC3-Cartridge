# Game Boy MBC3 Cartridge

This is my design of a flashable MBC3-based cartridge for the Game Boy. The MBC3 mapper improves a lot over the MBC1, and includes a real-time clock for everyone's favorite battery-sucking game.... Mary Kate and Ashley Pocket Planner! Oh, and Pokemon.

This circuit board should cover most, if not all, MBC3 games. The features are as follows:

- Able to make games up to 16 Mb in size, that use up to 256 Kb of RAM
- Compatibility with all four of the popular Game Boy battery management ICs - MM1026, MM1134, BA6129, and BA6735
- The option to add battery backup to the cartridge *without* the need of the original battery management ICs - perfect for MBC3 donors that didn't have batteries in them
- Fully compatible with the <a href="https://www.gbxcart.com/">GBxCart RW</a> so you can transfer games and save files to and from the board
- An option for making a multicart with shared SRAM between games that is triggered by resetting the console or power cycling (mostly for switching between Pokemon versions)

All gerbers and source files can be found in this repo, as this project is fully open source. Technical documentation of the board can be found in the Technical folder.

## Board Characteristics and Order Information

The zipped folder contains all the gerber files for this board. The following options **must** be chosen when ordering boards for yourself.

- Thickness: 0.8mm
- Surface Finish: ENIG
- Gold Fingers: Yes, 30Â° chamfer

**I sell this board on Etsy, so you don't have to buy multiples from board fabricators:**

You can alternatively use the zipped folder at any board fabricator you like. You may also buy the board from PCBWay using this link (disclosure: I receive 10% of the sale value to go twoards future PCB orders of my own):

The board is also listed on OshPark as well. **Be sure to get them in 0.8mm thickness if you order from here.**

## Board Configurations

The board comes with seven sets of jumper pads for solder bridges. SJ2, SJ3, SJ5, and SJ6 require you to solder bridge the middle pad either to the top or bottom pads, or left or right pads. SJ1, SJ4, and SJ7 are configured by either leaving them alone or bridging them with solder. Here are the situations where you need to add solder bridges.

### Making Games Without SRAM or Battery (SJ1)

Solder bridge SJ1 if your game does not use any SRAM or battery.

### MBC3 Type Select (SJ3)

The MBC3 chip you use from the donor cartridge can be one of a few different types:

- If your MBC3 doesn't have a revision letter on it (it just says "MBC3" on it) then bridge the middle pad of SJ3 to the left. (You will also need to populate Q1!)
- If your MBC3 *does* have a revision letter, such as MBC3A or MBC3B, then bridge the middle pad of SJ3 to the right.

### Making Games Without a U4 Donor Chip (SJ4)

The main function of U4 is battery management. It manages power from the battery to keep save data on the SRAM even when the Game Boy is off, shuts off components as power drops to prevent erroneous operation, and makes sure the SRAM is in a low-power state when running on battery power.

U4 can only be obtained from an existing Game Boy cartridge (or, potentially bought secondhand from eBay or AliExpress). U4 can be either MM1026 (or the equivalent BA6129) or MM1134 (or the equivalent BA6735). But, if you don't have one of these chips, you can use other parts that are commercially available to replace the function of these chips.

If you are not using U4, and instead using other parts for battery management, you must bridge SJ4. **But, this includes games that have no SRAM at all!** If your game does not have any save functionality, and you don't have U4 populated, you must bridge SJ4 too.

### SRAM Size Selection (SJ5 and SJ6)

These jumpers are located underneath the MBC3 chip, and labeled "64K" and "256K". Solder them to configure the amount of RAM your cart uses. You must configure these pads for every game you make, unless you do not need RAM. <a href="https://catskull.net/gb-rom-database/">You can find a list of games here with their respective RAM sizes.</a>

- If the game you're making uses 256Kb of SRAM, then solder the middle pads of the two jumper sets to the right pads.
- If the game you're making uses 64Kb of SRAM, then solder the middle pads of the two jumper sets to the left pads.
- SJ5 and SJ6 must be soldered in the same direction.

Note that you can make games that only require 64Kb of RAM and still use a 256Kb SRAM chip. You still need to configure the jumpers to the 64Kb setting, though.

### Multicart Jumpers (SJ2 and SJ7)

These are experimental. If you aren't making a multicart monstrosity, you can leave these alone. But if you are, here is the order you need to solder the jumpers in:

1) When programming the first ROM file to the cartridge, make sure SJ2 is soldered from the middle pad to the right. Then, program the first game.
2) Take the game out of the programmer, and switch the solder bridge on SJ2 to the other side - the middle pad should be bridged to the left. Program the second game.
3) Take the game out of the programmer, and remove all solder bridges on SJ2.
4) Bridge SJ7 for gameplay.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

Your parts list will vary depending on the game you are trying to make, and what chips you have for the battery management (if any). Note that C9 - C11 footprints are only included for edge cases that may require them; you can ignore them unless you run into issues.

Please carefully review the parts you need for the board you are trying to make. Do not add any parts to your build that don't appear in the column for the game you are making. This means you *cannot* populate every component on the board at the same time.

## Things to Remember

- The footprint for the EEPROM is specifically for 29F016 - it has 48 pins. However, 29F032 and 29F033 are only 40 pin devices. They still work fine on the board though - place them in the center of the footprint, and leave the outer two pins on each corner empty.
- The 29F016, 29F032, and 29F033 have been known to occasionally be defective upon arrival. They're usually only available from AliExpress.
- For battery management, use either U4 *or* U5 and U6 and supporting components. **Do not** use U4, U5, and U6 all on one board. They will interfere with each other.
- Kb is kilo**bits** and Mb is mega**bits**. Sometimes you will find game ROM and RAM sizes defined in terms of KB or kilo**bytes** and MB or mega**bytes**. You can convert Kb and Mb to KB and MB by dividing Kb or Mb by 8. For example, 256 Kb = 32 KB.
- You only need to provide ROM and RAM chips that have at least *or greater* the size of the game you are trying to make. That means you can use a 256Kb SRAM chip for a game that only requires 64Kb!
